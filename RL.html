<p style="color:pink">This essay isn't about grades or achievements.It's about something far,more frofound my heart felt gratitude for your unwavering love and support.
Looking back on my life,i see a tapestry woven with threads of your kindness,patience and wisdom.Each thread,seemingly small on it's own,has combined
to create a rich and vibrant life that I am incredebly greatful for.

From this earliest days you instilled in me a sense of security and belonging.Your love wasn't just a felling,it was a tangible presence,a comforting words 
after a fall,a reasuring voice during a storm of doubt.You taught me the importance of resilience,showing me how to pick my self up after setbacks and to 
face challenges with courage.I remember countless instances where your faith in me pushed beyond my percieved limitations,allowing me to achieve things I 
never thought possible.

Beyond the emotional support,you provide me with the tools I needed to navigate the world.You encourage my curiosity fostered my creativity,and supported.</p>
